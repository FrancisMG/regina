   <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> Thirteen (13) Regina Iustitiae alumnae took the 2009 Bar examinations on September 6, 13, and 20, and October 4 at the De La Salle University (DLSU), Taft Avenue, Manila. </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> 
     With the help of their sorority, the Regina barristers gracefully survived the six (6) months of bar review, despite the inopportune rainy season that spanned the bar exam period as well the postponement of the last day of the exams to the following week. Since April, each barrister had been receiving help from two (2) sisters serving as their study assistants, and a group of sisters serving as the central academics team. With no expense on the part of the barristers at all, their sisters had been helping them in literally every way possible.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> 
       Before the bar exam period itself, their sisters took care of enrolling them for their bar review; reminding them of bar review schedules; getting their Ateneo Central Bar Operations and other reviewers, and review books; researching their bar queries, whether exam-related or otherwise; and arranging for their travel to and from the Our Lady of Manaoag, Pangasinan, among others.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> 
         During the bar exam period itself, the sisters took care of the barristers by giving them at least two (2) sets of Purple Tips (the Regina Bar Operations Tips); getting their pre-week reviewers and Blue Tips; arranging for their transportation from Ateneo Law School to the hotel every Thursday or Friday; housing them for free at Pearl Manila Garden Hotel, Malate, for five (5) Saturdays, which includes the day to which last day of exams had been postponed; arranging for the blessing provided by Fr. Joaquin Bernas, Dean Emeritus of the Law School, at the hotel; delivering to their hotel room their coffee or meal when needed anytime of the day or night; giving them a transparent bag needed for the exams with their favorites comfort food; sending them off under umbrellas to DLSU every morning and every after lunch, alone or in groups, at their convenient time; picking them up at the DLSU gate for free lunch and free dinner at Wackoâ€™s, a cozy store located right in front of DLSU that the sisters fully reserved for them; and being present with ready hugs and kisses to give them a moral booster.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">
         With the complete support of sisters at no cost, the past months had surely been less stressful, if not stress-free, for the Regina barristers. </p>
