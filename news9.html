    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">   Last June 21, Warehouse 135 was packed with Ateneo Law Students for the annual Back-to-School party held to welcome the freshmen. Titled "SUMMONS: You Got Served!", the hip-hop and R&B party was also the first major fundraising activity of the Ateneo Law Student Council for the 2008 Ateneo Central Bar Operations. The party featured a fashion show, a dating game, a drinking contest, and the traditional student auction. The school-wide event was co-headed by Reginaâ€™s Bea Roque with Cris Lobregat. A number of sisters helped in organizing the event: Aubrey Martin and Darrelle Reyes headed the Marketing Committee. Julia Britanico was in charge of the Fashion Show. Krizia Baldemor and Mitch Suarez organized the dating game. The event was hosted by Eunice Monsod and AJ Constantino. Among the models were sisses Nicka Hosaka, Marga Lapid, Faye Gurrea, and Nica Almirez. They strutted down the runway sporting the latest designs of Moonshine and Team Manila. The dating game featured another Regina, Nica Bayot, as the female searcher for one dating game and Jenny Ang was one of the female searchees for the other. The highlight of the night was when Deb Sobrepena was auctioned off for P12,000, the highest bid of the night. This was the second highest bid in auction history; the record being held by, you guessed it right, another Regina, Trina Garcia who was auctioned off for a blank check.</p>
       <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">  All the proceeds of the auction, and the profits of the party, go towards funding Ateneo Law's Central Bar Operations for this coming Bar exams. The 2008 Back-to-School party was not only a successful fundraiser but a fun event where Ateneans forgot about their recits and cases and just partied the night away.</p>
