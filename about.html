      <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> The Regina Iustitiae Sorority was founded in 2005 by three women who were inspired by a vision. Anna Asuncion Angeles, Patricia Lee Alexandra Bautista and Anna Noreen Devanadera decided to not only form an organization but a family, specifically, a sisterhood. The women founders sought to bring into play their individual strenght to encourage excellence, support and participation in the establishment of a better Ateneo Law community and to play vital roles in the Philippine society. Its mission is clear, to forward women empowerment in the law school and to create an avenue for women advocates to achieve their full potential.</p>

      <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> Translated to mean QUEEN OF JUSTICE, the sorority has aptly chosen purple and yellow as its official colors. Purple is often associated with womanhood, nobility and spirituality, and yellow with leadership and strength, all of which are characteristics which and ideal Regina should possess. The official Seal of Regina Iustitiae was created and designed by Andrianne Marie Alazas from now grown to Ten Batches. The Sisters of Regina excel not only as well-rounded law students but also as professional and high-caliber lawyers in their practice.</p>

      <p> Regina Iustitiae, Sorore Lex Atheneum. </p>
      <p>Every year is our year.</p>

  <h1>What does it take to be Regina?</h1>
</div>
<div class="what-does-it-take-body">
<p>
      A Regina embraces womanhood not as a mere lifestyle but as a mission.  As a woman of the law, a Regina does not accept mediocrity. She is not contented with excellence alone but goes beyond that by refining the very core of her person. A Regina knows how to have faith in people and, most notably, in herself. A Regina believes that she is a part of a bigger whole and as such, willingly contributes to make her mark. To be a Regina means to be passionate, constantly committed and grounded. Every Regina is a Queen in her own right, a quintessence of royalty, elegance, leadership and significance.
