        <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">Ateneo Law School bested 15 other law schools in the recent 2009 National Moot Court Competition on International Humanitarian Law sponsored by the International Committee on the Red Cross last November 18-20. Team Ateneo won as overall champion and was also given the award for Best Memorial.  Regina Iustitiae’s very own Michelle Suarez (Batch 8-08) was awarded Best Mooter in the Final Rounds held at the Supreme Court En Banc Session Hall. Ateneo will be up against many of the top law schools in Asia and Australia as they represent the Philippines in the International Rounds for the Red Cross Moot Court Competition which will be held in Hong Kong, from March 5-6, 2010. </p>

      <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">  The Bar Examinations, no doubt, are the biggest hurdle in every law student’s life. It takes months of preparation and psyching up. The Ateneo Law School community, in being one with its barristers, holds an annual Send Offs ceremony on the eve of the first Bar Exam day.  This year’s Send Offs was co-headed by Nancy Martinez and Regina Iustitiae’s Nicka Hosaka (Batch 4-06).  On 05 September 2009, the 2009 Bar candidates, along with their families, friends, supporters and the rest of the ALS community gathered to celebrate the Send Offs mass presided by Fr. Joaquin Bernas, SJ at the ALS Chapel. Fr. B never fails to give those much needed words of wisdom and inspiration to the barristers. After the anticipated mass, ALS Associate Dean Atty. Sedfrey Candelaria delivered a short message to the barristers. To further boost the barristers’ psyche and to add a dash of school spirit, the solemn ceremony was culminated by Ateneo cheers led by the ALS-based Blue Babble Band and the singing of A Song for Mary.

    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> The ANC CVC Law Debates marks its 2nd year this 2009 as one of the most-watched and highest rated shows, where top law schools battle live on national television over current events and legal controversies and issues.  Representing the Ateneo Law School (ALS) were Glenn Tuazon, Joseph Dela Cuesta and Regina Iustitiae’s very own Kira Ang (Batch 6-07).  The team made it through the octafinals, quarterfinals and semi-finals to finally meet Ateneo de Davao head on at the finals.  The issue during the finals was about the necessity, beneficiality and practicability of President Arroyo’s putting a ceiling on the prices of some medicines, pursuant to the Cheaper Medicines Act.  The ALS team was on the negative side, opposing the price ceiling.  However, Ateneo de Davao proved to be the better team and took home the Grand Prize.  Regina Iustitiae is still very proud of their sis, Kira Ang, for representing the Ateneo Law School in this year’s CVC Law Debates.  </p>

   <div class="news-4-text">
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> Thirteen (13) Regina Iustitiae alumnae took the 2009 Bar examinations on September 6, 13, and 20, and October 4 at the De La Salle University (DLSU), Taft Avenue, Manila. </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> 
     With the help of their sorority, the Regina barristers gracefully survived the six (6) months of bar review, despite the inopportune rainy season that spanned the bar exam period as well the postponement of the last day of the exams to the following week. Since April, each barrister had been receiving help from two (2) sisters serving as their study assistants, and a group of sisters serving as the central academics team. With no expense on the part of the barristers at all, their sisters had been helping them in literally every way possible.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> 
       Before the bar exam period itself, their sisters took care of enrolling them for their bar review; reminding them of bar review schedules; getting their Ateneo Central Bar Operations and other reviewers, and review books; researching their bar queries, whether exam-related or otherwise; and arranging for their travel to and from the Our Lady of Manaoag, Pangasinan, among others.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> 
         During the bar exam period itself, the sisters took care of the barristers by giving them at least two (2) sets of Purple Tips (the Regina Bar Operations Tips); getting their pre-week reviewers and Blue Tips; arranging for their transportation from Ateneo Law School to the hotel every Thursday or Friday; housing them for free at Pearl Manila Garden Hotel, Malate, for five (5) Saturdays, which includes the day to which last day of exams had been postponed; arranging for the blessing provided by Fr. Joaquin Bernas, Dean Emeritus of the Law School, at the hotel; delivering to their hotel room their coffee or meal when needed anytime of the day or night; giving them a transparent bag needed for the exams with their favorites comfort food; sending them off under umbrellas to DLSU every morning and every after lunch, alone or in groups, at their convenient time; picking them up at the DLSU gate for free lunch and free dinner at Wacko’s, a cozy store located right in front of DLSU that the sisters fully reserved for them; and being present with ready hugs and kisses to give them a moral booster.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">
         With the complete support of sisters at no cost, the past months had surely been less stressful, if not stress-free, for the Regina barristers. </p>

        The Ateneo Society of International Law’s Mickey Colayco Cup Competition has always been the breeding ground for the country’s next top mooters, and Regina Iustitiae Sorority is proud to have had their share of success in this arena. In the recently concluded Colayco Cup last July 19, 2009, Regina’s very own Fay Irene Gurrea (Batch 9-08) and her team swept the competition by coming out Over-all Champions aside from their award for Best Written Memorial. Fay and her team ably represented the Applicant’s cause in the case concerning the Jilgenio River. Unsurprisingly, Fay was duly recognized as the Cup’s Best Speaker, solidifying her passion for excellence in the Ateneo Law School thus far.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> The 2008 Mickey Colayco Cup was held last July 27, 2008 with about 20 participants, 5 of whom proudly coming from Regina Iustitiae. Nica Almirez, Marga Lapid, Angelica Isaac-Lim, Beatrice Roque, and Deb Sobprepeña were among those that stood firm despite the dwindling number of participants and continued to jump over the hurdles that came with the Colayco Cup Competition.  It was definitely an opportunity that tested not only the sisters’ intelligence and perseverance in accomplishing this endeavor but more importantly it was a test of their commitment towards excellence.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">The Colayco Cup is one of the annual events held by the Ateneo Society of International Law (ASIL), opened to all aspiring law students who wish to become members of ASIL and excel in the field of International Law. It is pretty much similar to other international moot court competitions that ASIL participates in thus, potential members get a feel of how a competition abroad would feel like. The Colayco Cup is an excellent way of learning the basic principles of international law. This is because international law can be pretty abstract and thus the application of the doctrines in the cases given before the participants is an effective way that they can clearly understand and apply the concepts.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> The 2008 problem involved the conviction of Mr. Agustiz, a dual citizen, of a crime in a third country. Mr. Agustiz, through his country of origin, elevated the case to the ICJ on account of a violation of certain rights of due process that should be afforded to him under the Vienna Convention of Consular Relations. After the ICJ rendered its decision in favor of Agustiz, the enforcement of the said decision became the main issue of the Colayco Cup. Several convincing arguments and rebuttals later, Naydia Yoro and Mark Macaraeg of team 802 emerged victorious and were declared the 2008 Colayco Cup champions. </p>

      <div class="news-9-text">
       <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">   Last June 21, Warehouse 135 was packed with Ateneo Law Students for the annual Back-to-School party held to welcome the freshmen. Titled "SUMMONS: You Got Served!", the hip-hop and R&B party was also the first major fundraising activity of the Ateneo Law Student Council for the 2008 Ateneo Central Bar Operations. The party featured a fashion show, a dating game, a drinking contest, and the traditional student auction. The school-wide event was co-headed by Regina’s Bea Roque with Cris Lobregat. A number of sisters helped in organizing the event: Aubrey Martin and Darrelle Reyes headed the Marketing Committee. Julia Britanico was in charge of the Fashion Show. Krizia Baldemor and Mitch Suarez organized the dating game. The event was hosted by Eunice Monsod and AJ Constantino. Among the models were sisses Nicka Hosaka, Marga Lapid, Faye Gurrea, and Nica Almirez. They strutted down the runway sporting the latest designs of Moonshine and Team Manila. The dating game featured another Regina, Nica Bayot, as the female searcher for one dating game and Jenny Ang was one of the female searchees for the other. The highlight of the night was when Deb Sobrepena was auctioned off for P12,000, the highest bid of the night. This was the second highest bid in auction history; the record being held by, you guessed it right, another Regina, Trina Garcia who was auctioned off for a blank check.</p>
       <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">  All the proceeds of the auction, and the profits of the party, go towards funding Ateneo Law's Central Bar Operations for this coming Bar exams. The 2008 Back-to-School party was not only a successful fundraiser but a fun event where Ateneans forgot about their recits and cases and just partied the night away.</p>
