Aptly entitled “FORTIS! Regina: Bigger, Better, Stronger at 4,” the event celebrated the sorority’s tradition of unity, excellence and leadership. It was also a fund - raising affair for the sorority’s 2009 Bar Operations. Attended by over 300 guests, sisses, family and friends partied and danced all night to the sounds of DJ guest, Mark Marasigan, with free flowing drinks. The event was sponsored by Fuel Bar, San Miguel, Jagermeister and Boracay Grand Vista Resort and Spa with the participation of QTV.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify; padding-top:20px;"> This summer of 2009, Regina Iustitiae took a step further in reaching its goal of women empowerment. As advocates of this profound goal, the sisses went to Marillac Hills, an institution that reaches out and takes care of women who were abused and taken advantage of. These women undergo a program outlined by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and when completed or when ready, they are slowly ushered into facing the outside world again. </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;">For the event itself, the sisses, headed by Clarisse Vivar (Batch 9-08) and Nica Almirez (Batch 9-08), wanted the outreach activity to be fun and unforgettable, and not something so simple as just giving food and gifts. The organizers wanted to focus on interacting with teenagers so as to have better communication and to establish rapport much easier. Moreover, a detailed program was planned, in which the sisses and the girls of Marillac ate in groups while exchanging stories and participated in the games like Pinoy Henyo and “Marillac’s Got Talent.” There was a showcasing of talent and creativity which helped uplift the spirits of everyone, not to mention the willingness to share more and more of themselves and their lives on the part of the Marillac girls. The sisses, especially during the group sharing sessions, also made it a point to get everybody involved.  Amidst the music and laughter, it was important for the sisses to stress that as women, we should stand by each other and help in any way we can – the essence of being sisses, which is what Regina Iustitiae stands for. Towards the end of the program, everyone participated in the giving of “love notes” or messages they wanted to send out to each other – a fitting conclusion to an amazing day.</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify; padding-top:20px;"> he Bar Operations (Bar Ops) is the most important project of the sorority as it is centered on all the activities related to preparing for the Bar Examinations (Bar). The Bar is the most crucial episode in a law student’s life. It is a rite of passage that one must overcome in order to finally become a lawyer. </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify; "> 
      One of the sorority’s main thrusts and contributions to its members is the support given to the bar takers (barrister) during the Bar Ops. Each barrister is assigned a “buddy” who is a junior sorority sister who helps her all throughout the experience, from gathering all the exam requirements, to making sure that the study schedule is followed, to giving moral support. The sorority supplies her barristers with review materials, provides hotel accommodations (all expense paid), transportation, as well as the Sunday study area, and other needs during all four Sundays of the examination month.</p>
      <p style="text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;"> The significance of a very personalized Bar Ops experience is that it minimizes the ordeal that the barristers undergo through the dedication and support of the sisters- alumnae and residents alike. At the end of the Bar, the sorority comes together to celebrate everyone’s hard work and success.</p>
      <p> The Bar Ops experience not only helps the barristers but also the undergrads to stay true to the goal of becoming full-fledged Atenean lawyers.</p>
